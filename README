About
-----
ImProSA (Image Processing Sandbox Application) is a small set of
benchmarks for exploring GPGPU computation on mobile devices. The
benchmarks include a few simple filters: box blur, sharpen, sobel
and bilateral. These filters have been implemented in OpenCL, and also
using Halide (targeting both CPU and GPU). Frontends for both Android
and Linux are provided.
